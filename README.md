# Java-Exceptions-and-Collections-Project
This Java project demonstrates advanced proficiency in programming principles, emphasizing key concepts such as collections, exception handling, text-based file I/O, and code modification. Developed for one of my Java programming courses in Fall 2023, this assignment was divided into three distinct parts. In Part 1, the focus was on creating classes for managing restaurant data, with an emphasis on testing and data manipulation. Part 2 extended the project's complexity by implementing data file reading and writing capabilities. Finally, in Part 3, the project challenged students to generate summary reports for payment data within specified chains. This project not only equipped us with practical coding skills but also encouraged code standards and best practices throughout, including Checkstyle compliance and efficient use of software design principles
